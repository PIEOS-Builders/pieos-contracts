{{owner}} stakes the EOS amount of {{}} from the deposited EOS fund on the PIEOS SCO(Stake-Coin-Offering) contract.

The {{owner}} receives EOS-share (SEOS) and PIEOS-token share(SPIEOS) from the contract.

The amount of the received SEOS represents the ownership of the {{owner}}â€™s staked EOS tokens and the profits(excluding contract operation costs) from the staked EOS (EOS-REX profits and BP voting rewards).

The amount of the received SPIEOS represent the right to receive the PIEOS tokens issued to the SCO contract.

SPIEOS owner can get the newly-issued PIEOS tokens proportional to their SCO-staked EOS token amount and the staking time span, inversely proportional to the total amount of EOS tokens being staked by all SCO participants.
